      <v-card-text>
        <p>
          You are now running BlueOS <strong>B.E.T.A (Break it Early Test Application)</strong>!.<br>
          We have been working for the last couple of months on a totally new experience,
          and are now confident enough to open our work to a small number of users to test and check
          the changes!
        </p>
        <p>Be aware that the B.E.T.A may not be stable and changes will occur during the development.</p>
        <p>There are 3 types of releases on BlueOS.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Stable" releases, that are not available in this B.E.T.A
            <ul>
              <li>Stable and long supported versions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            "B.E.T.A" releases
            <ul>
              <li>Versions that will be released after an internal test</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            "Master" releases, not recommended
            <ul>
              <li>The very latest features, that may not have been tested yet</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We recommend using only the B.E.T.A releases.
